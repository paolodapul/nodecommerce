How I fixed the ff:

```
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/unbound-method */
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises */
```

- This occurred in my route files
- I fixed the unbound method error by changing the syntax of the controller from class-based to function-based. If not, you will have to do something like `authController.register.bind(authController);`
- I fixed the `no-misused-promises` part by adding an asyncHandler that serves as an HOC for my async route functions
