1. **Setup webhook Go binary**

On your EC2 instance, install a simple webhook listener like webhook (https://github.com/adnanh/webhook):

```
sudo apt-get install webhook
```

2. **Configure your paths, use absolute path**

Create a webhook configuration file (hooks.json).

```
[
  {
    "id": "redeploy",
    "execute-command": "/path/to/deploy.sh",
    "command-working-directory": "/path/to/your/app"
  }
]
```

Create the deployment script (deploy.sh):

```
#!/bin/bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Run the webhook listener:

```
webhook -hooks hooks.json -verbose
```

3. **Change permission of deploy script** `chmod +x`

4. **Open up port used by webhook in security groups - add as custom inbound rule**

5. **Add deployment workflow in Github Actions - trigger webhook by sending a POST request**

6. **Add the webhook URL, including the port number, as secret on GitHub**
