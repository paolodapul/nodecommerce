To add:

- Workflow
- Transaction Session

Implement the ff:

- Env config module (type safe), so you can access env vars in a single object
- Session-based workflow - each workflow should be wrapped in a session
- Standardize the response structure
  - status (via `res.status()`)
  - message
  - data
- Implement workflow on order and payment (use workflow for multi-step functions)
- Service - logic & third party

For guest session - use x-session-id

- if cart has session ID, it means the user is guest

Implement Zod validation as middleware, to pass to Express routes

Priority!

- Fork ecom-project-nodejs
- Create workflow for payment
- Create branch
