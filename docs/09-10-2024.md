Issues encountered when working on container builds

Problem:

- I had to use two separate docker build files when I was working on Mac M3

Solution:

- Offload the task of container building by using the free runners available on GitHub

---

Problem:

- The image I'm using remotely are not updating

Solution:

- Add the `dist/` file to .dockerignore to avoid using local tsc builds as source in the container
- Use CI runners to automate the container builds for you
