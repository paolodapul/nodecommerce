Practices:

JWT
First validation - parse token
Second validation - compare role

Refactor: in one call, know the role
Refactor: Superadmin and admin

- Superadmin - creates roles, has access to everything
- Admin

Refactor: move JWT verification to route definitions

- JWT and auth checking should be on route level
  Refactor: don't use private/public routes - contain everything in one - for portability and leaner code
  Refactor: use kebab casing

Feat: use MongoDB sessions
Feat: abort transaction if Zod validation throws an error
Refactor: use services for third party integration, use controllers for business logic

Authentication - check if user is valid - no database call yet - token level - check if token is valid first
Authorization - permission provisioning

? Start session
