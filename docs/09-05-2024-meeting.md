Notes:

Authentication vs Authorization

- Authentication - check if user is valid
- Authorization - permission provisioning

---

Todo:

Refactor: Superadmin and admin

- Superadmin - creates roles, has access to everything
- Admin

Feat: use MongoDB sessions
Feat: abort transaction if Zod validation throws an error
Refactor: use services for third party integration, use controllers for business logic

? Start session

---

Done:

- JWT

  - First validation - parse token, check if valid
  - Second validation - compare role

- Refactor: in one call, know the role of the user
- Do all auth-related work in one middleware (jwt and check permission)
- Refactor: don't use private/public routes - contain everything in one - for portability and leaner code
- Refactor: use kebab casing

- Refactor: move JWT verification to route definitions
  - JWT and auth checking should be on route level
